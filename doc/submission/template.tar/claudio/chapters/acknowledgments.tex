\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Throughout the years that have passed while working on what now composes this thesis I have made friends, learned a lot and had great fun.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Srdjan \v{C}apkun, for his support and guidance during my studies. He provided me with motivation and a push to achieve more that helped my development as a researcher and as a person. A friendship is the best outcome.

I would like to thank my co-advisors, Prof. N. Asokan, Prof. David Basin and Prof. Patrick Traynor for being on my dissertation committee and dedicating time to reading and evaluating this thesis.

This thesis would not exist if not for my co-authors Dr. Ramya Jayaram Masti, Nikos Karapanos, Dr. Claudio Soriente, Dr. Kari Kostiainen, Hubert Ritzdorf, and Prof. Aureli\'{e}n Francillon. The unending meetings and discussions enriched all of our publications.

Many thanks go to Dr. Ramya Jayaram Masti, Nikos Karapanos, Dr. Kari Kostiainen, Dr. Claudio Soriente, and Dr. Elizabeth Stobert for their help in improving this thesis.

The System Security Group is first a home and a family to all of its members. I would like to remember first my office mates with whom I shared so many days and laughs: Aanjhan Ranganathan, Dr. Ghassam Karame, Dr. Davide Zanetti, Dr. Elli Androulaki, Dr. Srdjan Marinovic, Dr. Claudio Soriente, and Nikos Karapanos. Even more laughs have been shared during lunches with everyone:

Over the years I have made great friends which I am sure will remain so, scattered throughout the world, for a long time: Davide Zanetti, Ramya Jayaram Masti, Claudio Soriente, Nikos Karapanos, Srdjan Marinovic and Aanjhan Ranganathan. Titles are not needed this time.

I will forever be thankful to my girlfriend Alessia, the \emph{real} doctor in the family, for all the love and support she has given me throughout these years. I extend my gratitude to my family in its entirety, but especially to my mother Donatella, to Mariano and to my father Rinaldo, who have taught me so much.
